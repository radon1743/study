Linked list is a collection of nodes where each nodes has information to some other node.
Each node consists of two things 
-  Value 
- Pointer to next value

Linked list are not of a fixed size 
The values are not stored sequentially

[D1 | P2] -> [D2 | P3] -> [D3 | P4]

There are some variants of linked list :

1) Singly Linked List 
	Normal Linked List 
2) Doubly Linked List
	Nodes having both pointers
3) Circular Linked List
	Normal Linked List with end node having next as First Node 
4) Doubly Circular Linked List 
	 Double Linked List with End Node next = First node prev
