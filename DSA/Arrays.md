Arrays are linear data structure, which is a collection of a certain data type, such as arrays of an numbers.

- Usually arrays are of fixed sizes 
- All the elements in an array are of same datatype.
- We can access data or values in an array using index values starting from 0 to n-1

Python uses List (similar to Arrays)

```python 
x = [1,2,3,4]
print(x[1])

#output
# 2
```
